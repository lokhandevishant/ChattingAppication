This client server chat application is based on java swing and used socket package. its
simple and easy and require only core java knowledge. I have taken this program from
internet and modified a little bit to make it simpler and more elegant.
This application/program is a good example of using java.io, java.net package to create a
chat application. A beginner of java language, who is familiar with this packages can
able, be beneficiate.
